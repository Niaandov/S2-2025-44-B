This here is to put my thoughts and 'documentation' as I do things. Will be removed or moved at a later date
You don't have to do this! This is a messy way to communicate my thoughts as I won't be able to remember them by
next meeting

Anim idea won't work out, as convenient as it'd be for two reasons
1) hard to make a queue for interruptions for error corrections
2) Anims are basically CSS properties and don't really have the capabilitiy to trigger an event when completed 

Good news! I missed a great feature that solves all of these; QTimers. It's literally a timer lmao

Current Idea:
* Keep track of the current state somehow. Via abstract number or something else. When the timer completes, switch to 
the next stage based on the stored state.

This allows for 'interrupts' where we can make it do some error correction anim. Throughput would be constant if we 
didn't do this so I assume we need to have the error correction take some time.

Two numbers? Current state and prior state. Mainly for interrupt purposes, since the user controls provide another
action that needs to be done before everything, but we don't want to just switch the action and stop the arm
from doing whatever. Prior state is checked after the interrupt/error action is called and then we go back to that after
interrupt completion. 



We can use this to tie pretty much everything to the AdvBoxQueue and a few other anim components. 

Timer (1s)
Box elements move to arm (or to appropriate space on the line) 
Timer (1s)
Arm grabs box and moves to the box. 
Timer (1s) 
Arm moves back to position 
Timer (1s) 
Box elements move to arm

(Not exactly like this, since we likely want the boxes to move to the correct space. Just an illustration of the 
process) 


Currently, timer process is stored on the individual task, so timers can run seperately. Will need to thread tasks

Rendering is fun, I lied effortlessly.

Using QGraphics for it, meaning that I have to learn how to anim components which may have to be done on a seperate timer
Resizing is extremely annoying due to the way that this works, essentially I have to figure out how to restrict it from
having a scrollable area because it really wants to be dynamic in a way we cant let it

It also is statically sized by PIXELS. everything in it is fucking static. Which is great but the second the screen is resized we have to
redo every fucking calculation. FUN.fuckkk i hate UI

Question for next time
* Does resizing have to be done dynamically or can we implement an option to select window size manually between several
common resolution sizes? 

You know like in a video game. Because the alternative is I get to have a fun minigame while coding where I get to try
to avoid blowing my fucking brains out.
